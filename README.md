# Market Data Hub

A production-ready data engineering project for Vietnamese stock market data processing and analysis.

## Overview

This project implements a complete data engineering workflow: extracting market data from VNStock API, orchestrating batch ingestion with Airflow, storing raw/processed data in MinIO (S3-compatible storage), loading structured data to PostgreSQL, and enabling analysis through Jupyter notebooks and Metabase dashboards.

**Key Technologies**: Python • Apache Airflow • Apache Spark • MinIO/S3 • PostgreSQL • Metabase • Docker

## What's Implemented

- ✅ **Batch Data Ingestion**: Python scripts for extracting stock and company data from VNStock API
- ✅ **Pipeline Orchestration**: Airflow DAGs for scheduling and monitoring data workflows
- ✅ **Data Lake Storage**: MinIO (S3-compatible) for bronze/silver layer data storage
- ✅ **Data Processing**: PySpark transformations for cleaning and structuring market data
- ✅ **Data Warehouse**: PostgreSQL for structured analytical data storage
- ✅ **Data Visualization**: Metabase dashboards for business intelligence and reporting
- ✅ **Exploratory Analysis**: Jupyter notebooks for ad-hoc data exploration and validation

## Quick Start

To run this project locally:

```bash
# Clone and navigate to project
git clone https://github.com/plat102/pj-market-data.git
cd pj-market-data

# Build and start services
make build
make up
```

### Accessing Services

Once services are running, you can access:

| Service | URL | Port | Credentials |
